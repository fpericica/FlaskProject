## Personal project - REST APIs with Flask and Python
### Created multiple endpoints to make different HTTP requests to an online Store App:
1. Stores
    1. GET - Get all stores
    2. GET - Get specific store
    3. POST - Create store
    4. PUT - Update store
    5. DELETE - Delete store
2. Items
    1. Same methods as above, for handling items
3. Tags (used to create different realations between tables, one-to-many, many-to-many)
    1. GET - Get all tags
    2. GET - Get specific tag
    3. POST - Create tag

Tech stack: Python3, Flask, Flask-Smorest (Blueprints, MethodViews, Marshmallow Schemas), SQLAlchemy, Docker.
